Task 1 - GitHub Skills Test
Mission preparation:
You need to register a user on GitHub and generate a pass for submitting files.

Execution method:
1. Create a local repository.
2. Then create a file for testing.
3. Add the test file to the native repository and commit the file.
4. Upload to the GitHub website.

Task check:
1. The upload failed because the upload path was not specified.
2. Because the submission is the master branch, there are two branches on GitHub. I didn't find it after logging in to the website, but found it later.

Result validation:

Create local library
Submitted successfully
