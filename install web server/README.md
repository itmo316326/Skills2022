Task 2 - Ansible Skills Test
Mission preparation:
Create two files and one file is used to specify the configuration information of ansible. The other file is the script file used to install the Apache service.

Execution method:
1. Execute the installation script
2. start the service
3. Authenticate to the server and access the page.

Task check:
Because the virtual machine is relatively old, it was unsuccessful in verifying server access. Still no results after repeated checks. Finally updated the virtual machine and restarted the virtual machine and web service and it worked.

Result validation:
Create a script file for users to install ansible.
Successful installation.
Testing successfully.
Access page.
