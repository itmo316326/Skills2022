Task 5 - Unit Testing
first assertion
Mission preparation:
Copy the test code for the task to a file in the local directory.
Create a test class to test this code.
Execution method:
Inherit Python's unit test class in the test class.
Then use the assertEqual method to numerically test the method in the code.
Task check:
When writing the test class for the first time, the name of the file was written as "unit test". The name conflicts with the keywords in Python, so the compilation fails. Later changed the file name and compiled successfully.
Result validation:
First assertion
Test 1 has no factor. The assertion succeeds because 1 has no factor.
 
Modify the script file and test 1 for factors. Output OK because 1 does not have a factor.
 
 
Second assertion
Test whether 6 has a factor, because 6 has a factor, but the number of elements in the list is greater than 1, so the assertion is successful.
 
 
Third assertion
test prime numbers
 
Since 2,3,5 are all prime numbers there is no assertion. The assertion succeeds because 9 is not a prime number.
 
Fourth assertion.
Test vowels.
 
It can be seen that the lowercase and uppercase letters AE are not asserted. Letter B asserts.
